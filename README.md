# Wrangling_PySpark
#### This repo contains a python jupyter notebook and a simple soccer data for novice data scientists to get started on PySpark using their local machines (single node cluster). 
I have come across several frustrating tutorials on PySpark promising to teach me PySpark in under five minutes. They are click baits and lack the necessary depth to get me started and keep me rolling. So, I decided to write an [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-project-driven-approach-to-learning-pyspark-4533c85f52b3) in hopes of helping new PySpark users with a project-driven tutorial as opposed to showing you code snippets and know-hows. Both the dataset and the code are included in this repo. Happy Learning!
